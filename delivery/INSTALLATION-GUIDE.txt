                           GETTING UPDATES
================================================================================

When Sam releases a new version:

1. Sam will send you a Google Drive link

2. Download the new "Covenant Acres Farmstand" folder

3. Delete your old "Covenant Acres Farmstand" folder

4. Replace it with the new one

5. Your data is safe - it's stored separately from the app

IMPORTANT: Do NOT delete the database in your AppData folder. That's your
real business data. The app folder can always be replaced.

                              BACKUPS
================================================================================

Your data is stored in:

To back up your data:
1. Close the app completely
2. Copy the "covenant-acres.db" file to a safe location
   (USB drive, Google Drive, etc.)

We recommend backing up weekly or after busy periods.
